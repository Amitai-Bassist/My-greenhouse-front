                    <h1>Old MacDonald smart greenhouse- The frame story</h1>
                    <p>
                        Old MacDonald has a farm and on his farm he had a greenhouse. He wanted to 
                        improve performance - increase the harvest and improve its quality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So he added sensors and made the greenhouse smart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sensors are connected to data base A which is located 
                        in the farm and connected directly to the main monitor-C1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The data from A goes to data base B which is stored in the 
                        cloud. and from there the information goes directly to the 
                        Android of old MacDonalds-C2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, 10% of the time there is a disconnection 
                        in the synchronization between the databases. In that time session 
                        he can update database B through the dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are welcome to see the data flow in the dashboard and try to 
                        update database B while there is no proper connection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, you can see in "My-solution" all the information about my 
                        solution, the technological tools I used, the architecture of the code 
                        and videos as well as links to view the code.
